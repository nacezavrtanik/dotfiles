THE MIRROR OF LOVE
==================

Even preceding landfall,
things loved freely once,
ignoring gender.

Blind desire
made pond-slime fish,
turned fish to apes with sex,
life's glorious engine,
churning in the mud.

The animals remember:
dolphins still rotate
their matings
between their own sex
and its reverse,
their raptures echoing
for miles.

On land,
the first societies,
great herds of she-beasts,
raised their young together,
without males,
whose part in reproduction
was unknown.

The women licked
and groomed each other
with men watching,
circling, circling round...

In the beginning then,
three million years
of motherhood.

The Word
came later,
and the word
was power,
was patriarchy:
firstborn children
squirmed on altars
of a father god.

The word
was law:
in Sumer,
women scorning men
had teeth crushed
with burned bricks.

Law,
once conceived,
applied to everything.

Leviticus condemned
most sexual practice
as unclean,
including that
between two men.

This was designed
to snub the Canaanites,
whose male priests
practiced sodomy.

Had they been
cannibals instead,
how different
might things be.

We gasped
upon Devonian beaches,
huddled
under Neolithic stars.

Spat blood
through powdered teeth,
staining each other
as we kissed.

Always we loved.

How could we otherwise.
when you are so like me,
my sweet,
but in a different guise?

We loved
while great Mediterranean
cultures flourished,
their homoerotic urges
troubling them
not at all.

Regarding man-boy
love as civilized,
the Greeks and Romans
made it thus a badge
of class and rank:
within their careful
edifice of power.

The Spartan army
ventured further:
male love
was enforced,
producing soldiers
who'd defend
theirfrontline lovers
to the death.

Demanding tougher breeds,
they exposed infants
to the elements,
particularly girls.

Perhaps because of this,
by the time Rome invaded
there were only sixteen
Spartans left.

Corinth's transvestite
troops aside,
this usage
was unique.

We were creators:

Homer sought in verse
to hug Achilles' shade,
while on her isle,
exquisite Sappho
reminisced of myrrh
poured on her lover's head:
ofgirls upon soft mats
with all they most desired
beside them.

Yet this tolerance
could not endure
the rise of Christianity,
which quite ignored
Christ's love for outcasts
and instead embraced
moral severity.

Defining sex as base,
an obstacle to faith,
St. Paul named
same-sex love,
for the first time,
as sin.

Ah, sin.

Was that its name,
which stole a kiss
behind the interlocking
shields of war?

Sin that made
Sappho weep
and write,
'I have not had
one word from her?'

With baby-blood
upon their hands
they saw our love
and named it sin.

Thomas Aquinas,
by the 13th century,
had systemized
degrees of vice,
including copulation
with an undue sex.

Since in the high dark ages
such pronouncements
were quite readily
made law,
burnings occurred:
beheadings:
bodies twisting
slowly in the breeze.

Although to hang
for sodomy alone
was rare,
such charges loaned
vendettas weight.

Knights Templar,
charged with sodomy,
had instead pressed
Philip of France
for debts
he couldn't pay.

The Pope,
owing Philip in turn,
arranged the Templars'
persecution.

Then, as now, our love
was used conveniently
as a smear.

As the Renaissance blossomed,
cities gradually returned,
and in their alleys
our subculture thrived,
a pale, night-blooming flower.

Despite church savagery,
an improved social clime
once more
brought forth
our Muse.

Thus, Michelangelo
gazed heavenwards
into a crowded Sistine sky
and told his dear Tommaso
that though vain,
malignant hordes attribute
what their grosser wills obey,
yet should
this love,
this faith,
pure joys afford.

How could he know,
upon his palette there,
creating heaven
from a hell
of cramped discomfort:
chisel trembling
on the brink of freeing
David's shoulder
from chill rock?

How could he know
what trials the future held,
how gross its will?

My love,
the vain, malignant hordes
are with us, with us still.

The 16th century favored
cross-dressed men
in women's roles,
forging a bond
between our culture
and theater
that endures today.

That era's greatest dramatist,
in sonnets to
his benefactor,
Mr. W. H.,
proclaimed his love
more ringingly
than he portrayed
the ruin of dynasties.

In time such 'friendship',
passionately expressed,
became the custom,
and society, having
no great desire to punish
what was then
a harmless commonplace;
having no word
for homosexuality,
could draw
platonic veils
across our love,
and look away.

Nowhere was this more evident
than with the Ladies of Llangollen,
women living openly together
in eccentric isolation,
objects of suspicion,
yet also of fascinated awe.

Amusing in their tantrums,
cherishing the picturesque,
they scattered rosebuds
round their cottage,
banished Wordsworth
when he slighted it in verse.

Without them,
history's diminished.

We grew, but in obscurity.

Emily Dickinson described
her lover's breast
as fit for pearls,
her words unread,
her voice unheard
'til she was dead.

Amidst his dust-tanned voice
Walt Whitman dream'd
a new City of Friends,
builded from tender glances
in the hired-hand scrum.

So Shakespeare dipped a quill
into his troubled soul,
while Eleanor and Sarah
fired their servants
and nailed poems to trees.

On Emily's pure heart,
her lover's weight a night...

Who'll care. my love?

Who'll guard
such fragile gems as these?

Only within enlightened cultures
could we breathe:

Natalie Barney's salon
scandalized and entertained,
where Gertrude Stein took tea
and Mata Hari, naked,
rode jeweled stallions.

Outrageous Natalie,
who, spurned by Renée Vivien,
delivered herself in a satin coffin
to the poet's door,
while Paris smiled.

Elsewhere,
in Leipzig, 1569,
one K. M. Benkert
first referred to
'homosexuality'.

Industrial England's view
that all might be
explained by science
prompted doctors
to declare us
merely ill,
not friends
or sinners
after all.

The molly-houses
rattled in the wind.

The climate changed,
as Oscar Wilde learned
to his cost, too fond
of working lads:
of feasting with panthers.

His beloved's father, a marquis,
denounced him as a sodomite.
Pressing for slander, recklessly,
Wilde was exposed,
condemned to Reading Gaol
then exiled in disgrace.

The era closed
with Wilde's mauve nineties
fading to gray,
and yet contained the seeds
of something proud, humane:

From Germany,
before the century's end,
came the first protests
against laws on sodomy.

Emancipation had begun.

Such times,
born to Tchaikovsky's guns
that could not drown
his whispering heart.

Such times,
that closed
with our first
faltering steps
to liberty...

And I marched
as I loved, my dear,
with thee,
always with thee.

Dignity marched
abreast with shame.

Disqualified from open love
we rendezvoused in squalor,
all we were allowed.

Our culture
embracing Colette,
writing so perfectly
with Missy's name
upon her anklet,
also came to know
dark hallways:
reeking lavatories,
reminded in our tenderness
of our equivalence
with shit.

The First World War, ironically,
allowed new closeness:
young men lived
and died together
in foreign mud.

There, Wilfred Owen
gave his love a sonnet
and disk of identity.
bidding his heartbeat kiss it,
night and day,
until the name grew blurred,
fading away.

Alas, war brought
not comradeship alone.
and in defeated Germany
the crippling war-debt
was a loam where
fascist flowers
thrived horribly.

By 1933, we were already
targets of the Reich,
but still did not suspect
how far we had to fall.

In slaughterhouses,
labeled with pink triangles,
our thousands died.

The showers, they say,
held bodies piled
as if the strong and desperate
had climbed on lovers' backs
to flee the gas,
betraying at the last
our love,
the thing we thought
they couldn't take.

Can you imagine?

Can you?

Darling, do not weep.

'Twas just a dream,
a nightmare gathered
on the century's brow,
and if it comes again
I'll hold you tight 'til dawn,
as well as I know how.

As day broke over Europe,
troops returned,
some bringing
newfound ways of life,
to settle on the Barbary Coast,
in Portsmouth
or New York.

New worlds
seemed possible,
and Ginsberg howled
against a state
that called us
communists,
not satisfied
with branding us
diseased.

The Mattachine Society,
America's first group
for homosexual men,
was formed in 1950,
followed by
the female-oriented
Daughters of Bilitis.

Meanwhile, England
saw campaigns
for homosexual rights,
while Orton wrote
of dark young men
with new
and dangerous
moralities.

In 1967,
Britain legalized
the sexual act
between consenting
adult males,
while gradually
across America,
states came
to modify
their laws.

Though still harassed
we were yet jubilant,
the first rung
in our climb
achieved.

We splashed
in Hockney's pools
and danced
to Brian Epstein's band.

On Friday,
June the 27th, 1969,
routine police raids
on the Stonewall Inn bar
in Greenwich Village
sparked the riots
from which
Gay Liberation
sprang.

Did Judy Garland's death
or did five thousand
years of history
propel us
through the streets
and with our anger
fire the night?

Remember running
in between
the blazing trashcans
holding hands,
laughing above the sirens,
unafraid and pure?

We knew
that freedom
could be won,
that nothing
could prevent it.

We were sure, my love.

We were so sure.

That was before the virus.

AIDS changed everything.

Though first
affecting heterosexuals,
who comprise nine tenths
of those afflicted worldwide,
church and press spoke
of a 'gay plague'.
And we, so close
to being recognized
as fully human were,
instead, transformed
to medieval bogeymen.

A human tragedy
thus licensed human bigotry.

Policemen claimed
to speak for God,
describing persons
having AIDS
as swilling in
a self-made cesspit,
while Councillor Brownhill,
a conservative,
recalled an earlier
final solution,
offering to
'gas the queers'.

And Margaret Thatcher
praised their forthrightness.

She let a clause
pass into law
that her chief minister
for local government
described as
being aimed
at banishing
all trace
of homosexuality:
the act itself,
all gay relationships,
even the abstract concept
would be gone,
a word torn
from the dictionary.

Shall we be scapegoats
as they used the Templars,
Canaanites and Jews,
or will AIDS force
abandonment of prejudice,
of furtive silence over sex,
to save their very lives?

As we approach
the future,
will Utopia's spires
hove into view,
or death-camp
chimney stacks?

My love,
I wish I knew.

While life endures we'll love,
and afterwards,
if what they say is true,
I'll be refused a Heaven
crammed with popes,
policemen, fundamentalists,
and burn instead,
quite happily,
with Sappho, Michelangelo
and you, my love.

I'd burn throughout eternity
with you.
