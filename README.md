dotfiles
========

This repository contains my custom config and shell commands. The setup is
intended to work on Debian-based Linux distros.

Setup
-----
Clone the repo to your home directory, then run:
~~~bash
~/dotfiles/init.sh
~~~

This will, among other tools, install and configure `alacritty`, `tmux`, and
`nvim`.

It will also extend the `PATH` env var to make the commands in `bin/` available
everywhere in Bash.
